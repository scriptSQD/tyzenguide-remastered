    "intro": "Hrodna Puppet Theatre has a surprisingly ancient and interesting story. Despite being known as a puppet theatre nowadays, it actually started as a usual theater with real actors.",
    "paragraphs": [
      "Firstly, the performances were held in Tyzenhaus palace, now there is a monument of the Eternal Flame on its place.",
      "In 1772, the theater building was constructed. It was connected to Tyzenhaus Palace by a covered walkway.",
      "Giuseppe Sacco - a famous Italian architect, who was invited by  Tyzenhaus, developed a project of the theater building. So, even though Antony himself wasn't involved in theatre's life too much, we can say, that the residents of Grodno should be grateful exactly to him for one of the most outstanding historical monuments of the city.",
      "After Tyzenhaus was exiled and all his titles were revoked, the  actors fled with him to Postavy. But the theatre wasn't uninhabited for a long period of time. At first, only touring groups performed in the theater's building. In 1802, Solomeya Daneveer received a permission to rent the building of the city theater for 10 years and organized a permanent cast. Her theater is considered to be the first professional theater in Hrodna.",
      "Some believe that the theatre can be considered as the first public theatre in Hrodna."
    ],
    "conclusion": "The building has changed its appearance countless times during its existence and has attracted spectators of all ages with its novelty and originality of performances. Nowadays, the theater building is considered to be a milestone of Hrodna history that perfectly fits the modern look of the city."
