          <em>
            Hey, Tyzenguide team here! Our today topic is The Karalino Country
            Estate of Tyzenhauz. So, let's start right away! </em
          ><br /><br />The Karalino country estate of Tyzenhauz is a bright, but
          until recently completely forgotten page of our national history. But
          even in its former abandoned form, it continued to be the most
          valuable cultural and historical heritage created by the mind and
          labor of people over not only decades, but centuries.<br />The remains
          of estate buildings, small architectural forms, household structures
          for various purposes, a water system, a park with a set of rare trees
          and plants were created in the spirit of fashionable architectural
          styles. They reflected the way of life, traditions, the spiritual
          world of entire generations and, in general, the culture of past
          times. The history of the Karalino estate is powerful and varied. In
          the 15th century the lands belonged to influential Tatar families.
          Then the estate was owned by Prince M. Glinsky. But a particularly
          bright page in the history of Karalino was written by the famous Count
          Anthony Tyzenhauz.<br />It was on his initiative that the creation of
          a magnificent palace and park complex began. A regular park was
          established. Residential and commercial buildings were erected. After
          Tyzenhaus, the estate passed from hand to hand. But too many cooks
          spoil the broth, you know. So in the beginning of the 20th century,
          the estate began to fall into decay, and the buildings were gradually
          turning into ruins.<br />The revival of the famous estate began in
          2003 by a group of enthusiasts led by the Klimuks who were not
          indifferent to the national history, purposeful and hardworking
          people. They've managed to raise a significant part of the buildings
          from the ruins, to improve the territory.<br />The whole world was
          restoring the estate temple - the chapel or "Kaplitsa". Today,
          religious ceremonies are performed here with the participation of a
          priest , weddings and christenings take place. Karalino country estate
          of Tyzenhauz today is an agro estate complex where everyone can find a
          vacation to their liking. Guest houses, banquet halls, a stable, a
          bathhouse and other entertainments are available to all guests.<br />The
          heart of Karolino is called “Ancestral nest”. It is a magnificent
          building in the center of the estate, it used to be a school, a shop,
          the owner's house and a restaurant. Now it's a large hotel with a
          restaurant and a lot of rooms.<br />But under the building we can see
          something mystical and scary. In the basement or catacombs the most
          famous people of Belarus from the Freemasons clan were meeting. Also
          there were a lot of barrels of wine. And now it's a big room where you
          can find a shelter to hide from the heat in summer.<br />Not far from
          the chapel there is a stable. It used to have a lot of horses but now
          there are two horses called Lenta and Bagira. Nowadays the stable is
          divided into two parts. One part is for horses, the other one is made
          for living and called “Oaks”. The name is given because of two oaks
          which hold the first floor of the house. And there is a legend that
          says: if you want to have good luck, you should rub the nose of a face
          carved on an oak tree.<br />The biggest building of the estate houses
          the museum and the art gallery. In the museum there are a lot of
          exhibits. You can see some maps, old pictures, books and mannequins of
          Tyzenhauz, paintings of Karolino and Hrodna. They were either bought
          by the owners of the estate or given to the gallery as a gift by
          artists who make their open-air paintings every year in Karolino.<br />One
          more fascinating building is marked on the map as a "hexagon". The
          window of the building depicts Bona Sforza. Now it's a residential
          house, but in Anthony times it used to be a big icebox. It's
          unbelievable, but it was used as a big storage for ice and food.<br />Near
          the estate you can find the river called Lososyanka. It was named in
          honor of the fish salmon. Salmon is a fish which likes cold water. So,
          the water in this river is very cold. Also the river goes through the
          lake which used to be a swamp. The lake is amazing, especially in
          winter! Karalino country estate is a beautiful place to relax about 20
          minutes drive from the center of Hrodna. Weddings and other outdoor
          events are often held here, tourists stop here; but if you just want
          to admire the beautiful buildings, you can get to the territory of the
          estate with no hustle and for free.<br />In the end, we hope this was
          an interesting story and you've learnt smth new. We'll see you in the
          other videos. So, bye for now!
