          Antoni Tyzenhauz is one of the most prominent figures in the history
          of our wonderful city. Thanks to his activities the architectural
          character of Hrodna was changed and a number of marvellous historical
          sights appeared. Antoni Tyzenhauz was a reformer, a dreamer, an
          enthusiast, gushing with ideas and actions. He inspired and was
          inspired. In turn, we decided to walk along the memorable roads of
          Tyzenhauz in Hrodna to show his priceless heritage. We hope you'll
          enjoy the guide to the sights of our heartwarming city commemorating
          the personality of Antoni Tyzenhauz and his outstanding deeds.
