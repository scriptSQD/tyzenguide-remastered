# Tyzenguide Remastered - the revival.
We were at the risk of losing it all, but then Tyzenguide Remastered was born... This is the revival of not even started Web-Application for the Tyzenguide project.  
  
Headed by the fellow members of Hrodna City Gimnasium, this project represents the cultural legacy of our wonderful city in the most modern way. Captivating videos, interesting stories and user-friendliness of the web application are the main traits of our success here.  
  
We want to spread the word and let you do something similar. Documentation for data structure will eventually be provided to help others sort out the principles, used in our work.
